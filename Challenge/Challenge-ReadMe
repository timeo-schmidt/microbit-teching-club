*** Welcome To The Challenge ***

The task is to transmit a secret message to your friend ...

You are competing against the other team and your team needs to develop a system
via which you can transmit any message from one microbit to the other.

YOUR TASK:
  - Set up one microbit so it can send a message when you press a button.
  - Set up the other microbit to read out the message on the display.
  - To proof that it's working I am going to type in a secret message in the code
    of the sender and when the receiver shows this secret message you are successful.

  - The team that is able to complete the messaging system faster WINS...

Good Luck
